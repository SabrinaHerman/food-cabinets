As it is named, this python script automatically login/logout your Facebook account and posting your text-based content on the Facebook Group Pages you are a member of.

### How does it do or Instructions to use?

- Download FacebookBot Script, and extract it somewhere in the system

- **Required/Important:**
  - Open **fb_credentials.json** in notepad, and replace **yourloginemail** with your Facebook login email address, and email address should come between double-quotes. Also, perform the same thing with **yourpassword**, put your Facebook login password there (should come between double quotes).
  - To post the desire status/text, open the **PostingContents.txt** file in notepad, and add text there (this will not come in the double quotes).
  - After performing the two above steps, run the start_post exe.

### Is it safe to use, and I have given my Facebook credentials?
Yes, it is safe. It will use your credentials to only log in to your account, and all posting process will happen in front of you. Once you run the running command in cmd, it will open separate/another chrome, and do the posting work.
